PACKMAN GUI
===========

Along with the CLI and API, many of the PACKMAN features are also available via GUI. To access the GUI, please enter the following command.::

    python -m packman gui
    #OR
    python3 -m packman gui

Important Notes:
 - Windows will have .exe extension for Python
 - Please check the working directory for the output files of the GUI options.
 - For Python3, tkinter might not be installed by default on some systems (mainly Linux). Please use `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` or the other OS alternative to this.
